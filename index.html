      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="assets/images/Profile.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="artwork profile">
      <p>I am a extremely active person, love to socialize and hang out with friends at zilker park or the greenbelt whenever and absolutely love to explore and try out different restraunts. Some of my main interests include weightlifting/games/traveling/manga/anime/creating webtoons/ and video games. Spend most of my time working or just trying to learn new things like this fullstack course which i am absolutely in love with. Some cool hobbies ive picked up over the years include working at magnolia design center and creating fantastic custom sound or home theater rooms all over the austin area, being able to have such freedom to create an amazing product for a customer is a great feeling and this creativity followed me into creating webtoons on the internet and having fun creating my own stories and images to go along with.</p>
      <p>I am originally from Dallas, park cities university park born and raised there april 12, 1990. Ive moved around to a few areas in my lifetime such as colorado for my early middle years of my life then to austin.If i had to pick my most favorite place that I have lived in life, it would be Austin mainly because its an extremely clean city with so much to do as well as how laid back the city is.</p>
